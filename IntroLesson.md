Okay, well _What is programming?_
**_Programming_** is the practice of writing instructions to be followed by a computer. A program (a series of one or more files) is basically the means to instruct a computers operating system to do things. Any program has inputs (from another file, or the user), executions of tasks or calculations, and outputs (displays to the user, or return values to other programs). A **_programming language_** is an agreed upon set of symbols and keywords that have particular meaning in order to write instructions readable by the computer.  
Every programming language has what we call **_Syntax_** and **_Semantics_**. Syntax are the rules of how symbols and keywords are to be used and arranged in a program. Semantics describes the _meaning_ that the syntax conveys. For example, in the expression,  
```IF (x + 2) EQUALS 3 THEN X EQUALS 1```  
`IF` , `+` , `EQUALS` and `THEN` are all examples of syntax. The semantics relate to the MEANING of the symbol arrangements, like the conclusion that x must equal 1 **if** x+2 is already true. Syntax needs semantics to have any meaning. I could write any old syntax like `IF x + 2 EQUALS 3 THEN  x = 900` might be using good syntax (IF, THEN, =), but The semantics (or logic) are definitely wrong, 900 + 2 is certainly not 3.

_What is a web browser?_ 
A web browser is the way you are able to see web pages, Any web-browser is a program that allows a user or client (like you) To make requests to web addresses (Like github.com), and view their responses (like all the fancy HTML) That you are reading from right now. Inside your web browser (maybe its chrome, maybe its firefox), Javascript (the programming language) can run to do cool things like make stuff happen when you click a button.
