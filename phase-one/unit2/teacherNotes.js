// VARIABLES... WHAT'S A VARIABLE? 

// It's just the name of a place where I want to keep my data.... 

// There are different kinds of data. If we distinguish between them the computer is a lot easier to work with.

// Text! We already saw text in the console.log("HEllo, World!"). That's right! The "Hello, World!" (the stuff in quotes) is text. 
// here's what storing some text in a variable looks like. We give the variable a name, then set it equal to something.... 

let myFirstVariable = "just some text"; 

// every line gets completed with a semi-colon. 

let anInt = 90;

let aDouble = 90.9;

let aString = "Hello";

let aBool = true;

// some math.... + - / * 
// || && !
