### 👨‍💻 UNIT TWO (Variables: I want the computer to keep information for me) 
- We'll talk about what a variable is (and what it means), the different types and declarations, and how to use them in programming.
- Additionally, we'll talk about putting things together with operators (including ternary), assignments, equalities, and inequalities

#### 🐒 Primitives 
- int 
- double
- string
- bool 
- NaN
#### 🦾 Assignment! 
- Create a variable named `myString` and set it equal to `"A string"` 
- make a variable called `myInt` and set make it store the number `10`
- Set the variable `myDouble` equal to `3.14159`

#### 🗡️ Operators
- math operations 
- boolean operations

#### ⏲️ ASSIGNMENT! 
- step 1) create variables called `x` and `y`, setting them equal to 1 and 2 respectively. 
- step 2) create variables called `sum` , `difference` , `product` to store the respective operations on x and y. 
- step 3) log each of the three results to the screen. 
Example:

```
let x = 1;
let y = 2;
let sum = x + y;
console.log(sum);
```

#### 🗳️ Structures / Containers 
- arrays and their methods part 1 
    - `.push()` 
    - `.length`
    - `.at()`
    - `.join()`
    - `.sort()`
    - `.reverse()`
- objects 
- 🚗 mini assignment TBA
