# UNIT FOUR (Loops and Functions: I want the computer to do things...)
## ♻️ Loops 
- for loop
- while loop (Write a number guessing game as the class example...)
- do while loop
- continue keyword 
- break keyword
- 🚗 mini assignments TBA
    - write a loop that prints to the console the numbers 0-9 
    - write a loop that prints to the console the numbers 1-10 
    - write a loop that prints the numbers 10-1 
    - write a loop that prints the numbers 9-0 
    - now write a loop to create an array containing the numbers 0-9.
    - write a loop to print each item in an array...
    - write a loop that will see if your array contains the number 11 what about 4?.... 
    - write a loop to see if each item in an array is an int. 
    - write a loop that adds the number one to each item in the array. 
    - write a loop to sum up all the numbers in the array. 
    - *write a loop to find the maximum of an array....*  
    - *write a loop to find the minimum...*  
    
## 🛠️ Functions
- use and practice 
- syntax 
- returns
- calls
- args and calls
- args, returns, calls
- recursion! (another way to loop!)
- 🚗 mini assignment TBA 

## 🗳️ Structures / Containers ADVANCED
- arrays and their methods part 2 
    - A review of what we looked at last time... In case we forgot.
    - `.splice()` 
    - `.filter()`
    - `.forEach()`
    - `.map()`
    - `.some()`
    - `.every()`

- objects and their methods part 2 
- 🚗 mini assignment 
    - Write a function to remove an item from an array. It will need to take an argument as to what we want to remove. It will then make sure that arg is actually in the array. It will then call .splice() to remove the item `.splice(array.indexOf(),1)` and return the new spliced array to the caller. O.o  
    - choose one of the new methods we learned about to replace one of the loops we made in the first array lesson.
