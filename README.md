# A Word of Welcome! 👋
### A primer (What is javascript?) 🕹️ 
Javascript is a computer language that allows developers to write scripts that can be executed in your web browser (That's called front end), or programs ran on a computer / server (that's called backend). 

# 🤓 Who's the teacher? 
- Hi! I'm Austin. I am a fullstack web developer and part time math and computer science tutor. In my down time I love hanging out with my wife Hannah, journaling, petting our little cat Lu, and playing acoustic guitar. 

# 👀 What We'll Cover 
For this course I want to make sure that you have a solid introduction to core concepts of computer programming. We'll talk about problem solving and creating good user / developer experiences both in terms of thinking programmatically and writing clean code to solve problems. 
First, we'll need a solid understanding of computer programmer toolbox. We'll explore how to use the tools that almost every computer programming language has (in one form or another). After that we'll talk about the things that are harder to describe and memorize but maybe the most important; principals of problem solving. As we mentioned already, we're going to use javascript to do that in the context of "front end" web development. (PS curiosity is a great thing! If your curious, here's a great link to [checkout javascript]()). Stay tuned for these! 

##  🧰 PHASE ONE (The Toolbox) 

### 👋 UNIT ONE "Hello, World!":  
- Talk basics of programming, the web, and what we'll be doing in the course. 
- We'll get our feet wet with two very basic tools we'll see a whole lot of - console.log() and alert(). 
- We'll also look at "_where_" we'll do our coding in the computer with _just enough_ html to get us moving with js. 
- 🚗 mini assignment TBA

### 👨‍💻 UNIT TWO (Variables: I want the computer to keep information for me) 
- We'll talk about what a variable is (and what it means), the different types and declarations, and how to use them in programming.
- Additionally, we'll talk about putting things together with operators (including ternary), assignments, equalities, and inequalities
