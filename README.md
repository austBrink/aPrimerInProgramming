# A Word of Welcome! 👋
### A primer (What is javascript?) 🕹️ 
Javascript is a programming language that runs in a web browser (or in an engine like Nodejs on a server) used as a programming language to make applications.

# 👀 What We'll Cover 
For this course I want to make sure that you have a solid introduction to core concepts of computer programming. We'll talk about problem solving and creating user / developer experiences both in terms of thinking programmatically to write clean code to solve real problems. 
First we'll need a solid understanding of computer programmer toolbox. We'll explore how to use that tools that almost every computer programming language has (in some form or another). Then we'll talk about the more abstract things --problem solving-- to help us solve problems. As we mentioned, we're going to use javascript to do that. (PS curiosity is a great thing! Here's a great link to [checkout javascript]()).
##  🧰 PHASE ONE (The Toolbox) 
### 👋 LESSON ONE "Hello, World!":  
- Talk basics of programming, the web, and what we'll be doing in the course. 
- We'll get our feet wet with two very basic tools we'll see a whole lot of - console.log() and alert(). 
- We'll also look at "_where_" we'll do our coding in the computer. 
- 🚗 mini assignment TBA
### 👨‍💻 LESSON TWO Variables
- We'll talk about what a variable is (what it means), their different types and declarations, and how to use them in programming.
- Additionally we'll talk about putting things together with operators (including ternary), assignments, equalities, and inequalities
#### 🐒 Primitives 
- int 
- double
- string
- bool 
- NaN
- 🚗 mini assignment TBA
#### 🗳️ Structures / Containers 
- arrays and their methods 
- objects and their methods 
- 🚗 mini assignment TBA
#### 🗡️ Operators
- math operations 
- boolean operations
- ternary 
### LESSON THREE 
#### 🖱️ Input / Output 
- discussion of I/O
- keyboard input (using prompt)
- text output (using console.log and alert)
#### ❓ Conditionals 
- if 
- if else 
- recap of ternary
